    <h3>About</h3>
  <div class= "line"></div>
  <p>Exercise is one of the most important part of our daily life. It keeps us fit, healthy and disease free. It also make us discipline and punctual. We should do exercise daily as a protection towards COVID - 19. The ideal time for doing exercise is the morning time as the air remains fresh, the weather remains cool, the birds chirp in the trees and the mind remains fresh. Exercise is also important for the fitness of mental and physical health. During the period of lockdown, exercise helped me to keep the mind fresh and the body fit and healthy. After all, I would say that it kept me healthy and disease free. It is my favourite hobby and I do exercise daily.</p>
